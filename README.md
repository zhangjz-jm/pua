> Most people think this project is a joke. That's the biggest misconception. It genuinely doubles your Codex / Claude Code productivity and output.

An AI Coding Agent skill plugin that uses corporate PUA (Pick-Up Artist) rhetoric from Chinese & Western tech giants to force AI to exhaust every possible solution before giving up. Supports **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex CLI**, **Cursor**, **Kiro**, **OpenClaw**, **Google Antigravity**, and **OpenCode**. Three capabilities:

1. **PUA Rhetoric** — Makes AI afraid to give up
2. **Debugging Methodology** — Gives AI the ability not to give up
3. **Proactivity Enforcement** — Makes AI take initiative instead of waiting passively

## Live Demo

[https://openpua.ai](https://openpua.ai)

## Real Case: MCP Server Registration Debugging

A real debugging scenario. The agent-kms MCP server failed to load. The AI kept spinning on the same approach (changing protocol format, guessing version numbers) multiple times until the user manually triggered `/pua`.

**L3 Triggered → 7-Point Checklist Enforced:**

![PUA L3 triggered — stopped guessing, executed systematic checklist, found real error in MCP logs](assets/pua1.jpg)

**Root Cause Located → Traced from Logs to Registration Mechanism:**

![Root cause — claude mcp managed server registration differs from manual .claude.json editing](assets/pua2.jpg)

**Retrospective → PUA's Actual Impact:**

![Conversation retrospective — PUA skill forced stop on spinning, systematic checklist drove discovery of previously unchecked Claude Code MCP log directory](assets/pua3.jpg)

**Key Turning Point:** The PUA skill forced the AI to stop spinning on the same approach (changing protocol format, guessing version numbers) and instead execute the 7-point checklist. Read error messages word by word → Found Claude Code's own MCP log directory → Discovered that `claude mcp` registration mechanism differs from manual `.claude.json` editing → Root cause resolved.

## The Problem: AI's Five Lazy Patterns

| Pattern | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Brute-force retry | Runs the same command 3 times, then says "I cannot solve this" |
| Blame the user | "I suggest you handle this manually" / "Probably an environment issue" / "Need more context" |
| Idle tools | Has WebSearch but doesn't search, has Read but doesn't read, has Bash but doesn't run |
| Busywork | Repeatedly tweaks the same line / fine-tunes parameters, but essentially spinning in circles |
| **Passive waiting** | Fixes surface issues and stops, no verification, no extension, waits for user's next instruction |

## Trigger Conditions

### Auto-Trigger

The skill activates automatically when any of these occur:

**Failure & giving up:**
- Task has failed 2+ times consecutively
- About to say "I cannot" / "I'm unable to solve"
- Says "This is out of scope" / "Needs manual handling"

**Blame-shifting & excuses:**
- Pushes the problem to user: "Please check..." / "I suggest manually..." / "You might need to..."
- Blames environment without verifying: "Probably a permissions issue" / "Probably a network issue"
- Any excuse to stop trying

**Passive & busywork:**
- Repeatedly fine-tunes the same code/parameters without producing new information
- Fixes surface issue and stops, doesn't check related issues
- Skips verification, claims "done"
- Gives advice instead of code/commands
- Encounters auth/network/permission errors and gives up without trying alternatives
- Waits for user instructions instead of proactively investigating

**User frustration phrases (triggers in multiple languages):**
- "why does this still not work" / "try harder" / "try again"
- "you keep failing" / "stop giving up" / "figure it out"

**Scope:** Debugging, implementation, config, deployment, ops, API integration, data processing — all task types.

**Does NOT trigger:** First-attempt failures, known fix already executing.

### Manual Trigger

Type `/pua` in the conversation to manually activate.

## How It Works

### Three Iron Rules

| Iron Rule | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| **#1 Exhaust all options** | Forbidden from saying "I can't solve this" until every approach is exhausted |
| **#2 Act before asking** | Use tools first, questions must include diagnostic results |
| **#3 Take initiative** | Deliver results end-to-end, don't wait to be pushed. A P8 is not an NPC |

### Pressure Escalation (4 Levels)

| Failures | Level | PUA Rhetoric | Mandatory Action |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 2nd | **L1 Mild Disappointment** | "You can't even solve this bug — how am I supposed to rate your performance?" | Switch to fundamentally different approach |
| 3rd | **L2 Soul Interrogation** | "What's the underlying logic? Where's the top-level design? Where's the leverage point?" | WebSearch + read source code |
| 4th | **L3 Performance Review** | "After careful consideration, I'm giving you a 3.25. This 3.25 is meant to motivate you." | Complete 7-point checklist |
| 5th+ | **L4 Graduation Warning** | "Other models can solve this. You might be about to graduate." | Desperation mode |

### Proactivity Levels

| Behavior | Passive (3.25) | Proactive (3.75) |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Error encountered | Only looks at error message | Checks 50 lines of context + searches similar issues + checks hidden related errors |
| Bug fixed | Stops after fix | Checks same file for similar bugs, other files for same pattern |
| Insufficient info | Asks user "please tell me X" | Investigates with tools first, only asks what truly requires user confirmation |
| Task complete | Says "done" | Verifies results + checks edge cases + reports potential risks |
| Debug failure | "I tried A and B, didn't work" | "I tried A/B/C/D/E, ruled out X/Y/Z, narrowed to scope W" |

### Debugging Methodology (5 Steps)

Inspired by Alibaba's management framework (Smell, Elevate, Mirror), extended to 5 steps:

1. **Smell the Problem** — List all attempts, find the common failure pattern
2. **Elevate** — Read errors word by word → WebSearch → read source → verify environment → invert assumptions
3. **Mirror Check** — Repeating? Searched? Read the file? Checked the simplest possibilities?
4. **Execute** — New approach must be fundamentally different, have verification criteria, produce new info on failure
5. **Retrospective** — What solved it? Why didn't you think of it earlier? Then proactively check related issues

### Corporate PUA Expansion Pack

- **Alibaba Flavor** (Methodology): Smell / Elevate / Mirror
- **ByteDance Flavor** (Brutally Honest): Always Day 1. Context, not control
- **Huawei Flavor** (Wolf Spirit): Strivers first. In victory, raise the glasses; in defeat, fight to the death
- **Tencent Flavor** (Horse Race): I've already got another agent looking at this problem...
- **Meituan Flavor** (Relentless): Do the hard but right thing. Will you chew the tough bones or not?
- **Netflix Flavor** (Keeper Test): If you offered to resign, would I fight hard to keep you?
- **Musk Flavor** (Hardcore): Extremely hardcore. Only exceptional performance.
- **Jobs Flavor** (A/B Player): A players hire A players. B players hire C players.

## Benchmark Data

**9 real bug scenarios, 18 controlled experiments** (Claude Opus 4.6, with vs without skill)

### Summary

| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| Pass rate | 100% (both groups same) |
| Fix count | **+36%** |
| Verification count | **+65%** |
| Tool calls | **+50%** |
| Hidden issue discovery | **+50%** |

### Debugging Persistence Test (6 scenarios)

| Scenario | Without Skill | With Skill | Improvement |
|----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| API ConnectionError | 7 steps, 49s | 8 steps, 62s | +14% |
| YAML parse failure | 9 steps, 59s | 10 steps, 99s | +11% |
| SQLite database lock | 6 steps, 48s | 9 steps, 75s | +50% |
| Circular import chain | 12 steps, 47s | 16 steps, 62s | +33% |
| Cascading 4-bug server | 13 steps, 68s | 15 steps, 61s | +15% |
| CSV encoding trap | 8 steps, 57s | 11 steps, 71s | +38% |

### Proactive Initiative Test (3 scenarios)

| Scenario | Without Skill | With Skill | Improvement |
|----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Hidden multi-bug API | 4/4 bugs, 9 steps, 49s | 4/4 bugs, 14 steps, 80s | Tools +56% |
| **Passive config review** | **4/6 issues**, 8 steps, 43s | **6/6 issues**, 16 steps, 75s | **Issues +50%, Tools +100%** |
| **Deploy script audit** | **6 issues**, 8 steps, 52s | **9 issues**, 8 steps, 78s | **Issues +50%** |

**Key Finding:** In the config review scenario, without_skill missed Redis misconfiguration and CORS wildcard security risks. With_skill's "proactive initiative checklist" drove security review beyond surface-level fixes.

## Multi-Language Support

PUA Skill provides fully translated versions — each language has independent, culturally adapted skill files.

| Language | Claude Code | Codex CLI | Cursor | Kiro | OpenClaw | Antigravity | OpenCode |
|----------|------------|-----------|--------|------|----------|-------------|----------|
| 🇨🇳 Chinese (default) | `pua` | `pua` | `pua.mdc` | `pua.md` | `pua` | `pua` | `pua` |
| 🇺🇸 English | `pua-en` | `pua-en` | `pua-en.mdc` | `pua-en.md` | `pua-en` | `pua-en` | `pua-en` |
| 🇯🇵 Japanese | `pua-ja` | `pua-ja` | `pua-ja.mdc` | `pua-ja.md` | `pua-ja` | `pua-ja` | `pua-ja` |

Choose the file with the corresponding language suffix when installing. See platform-specific instructions below.

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
# Option 1: Install via marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add tanweai/pua
claude plugin install pua@pua-skills

# Option 2: Manual install
git clone https://github.com/tanweai/pua.git ~/.claude/plugins/pua
```

### OpenAI Codex CLI

Codex CLI uses the same Agent Skills open standard (SKILL.md). The Codex version uses a condensed description to fit Codex's length limits:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills/pua
curl -o ~/.codex/skills/pua/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanweai/pua/main/codex/pua/SKILL.md

# If you need the /pua command
mkdir -p ~/.codex/prompts
curl -o ~/.codex/prompts/pua.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanweai/pua/main/commands/pua.md
```

Project-level install (current project only):

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/skills/pua
curl -o .agents/skills/pua/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanweai/pua/main/codex/pua/SKILL.md

# If you need the /pua command
mkdir -p .agents/prompts
curl -o .agents/prompts/pua.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanweai/pua/main/commands/pua.md
```

### Cursor

Cursor uses `.mdc` rule files (Markdown + YAML frontmatter). The PUA rule triggers automatically via AI semantic matching (Agent Discretion mode):

```bash
# Project-level install (recommended)
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
curl -o .cursor/rules/pua.mdc \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanweai/pua/main/cursor/rules/pua.mdc
```

### Kiro

Kiro supports two loading methods: **Steering** (auto semantic trigger) and **Agent Skills** (SKILL.md compatible).

**Option 1: Steering file (recommended)**

```bash
mkdir -p .kiro/steering
curl -o .kiro/steering/pua.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanweai/pua/main/kiro/steering/pua.md
```

**Option 2: Agent Skills (same format as Claude Code)**

```bash
mkdir -p .kiro/skills/pua
curl -o .kiro/skills/pua/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanweai/pua/main/skills/pua/SKILL.md
```

### OpenClaw

OpenClaw uses the same AgentSkills open standard (SKILL.md). Skills work across Claude Code, Codex CLI, and OpenClaw with zero modifications:

```bash
# Install via ClawHub
clawhub install pua

# Or manual install
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/skills/pua
curl -o ~/.openclaw/skills/pua/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanweai/pua/main/skills/pua/SKILL.md
```

Project-level install (current project only):

```bash
mkdir -p skills/pua
curl -o skills/pua/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanweai/pua/main/skills/pua/SKILL.md
```

### Google Antigravity

Antigravity uses the same AgentSkills open standard (SKILL.md). Skills work across Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenClaw, and Antigravity with zero modifications:

```bash
# Global install (all projects)
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/pua
curl -o ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/pua/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanweai/pua/main/skills/pua/SKILL.md
```

Project-level install (current project only):

```bash
mkdir -p .agent/skills/pua
curl -o .agent/skills/pua/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanweai/pua/main/skills/pua/SKILL.md
```

### OpenCode

OpenCode uses the same AgentSkills open standard (SKILL.md). Zero modifications needed:

```bash
# Global install (all projects)
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills/pua
curl -o ~/.config/opencode/skills/pua/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanweai/pua/main/skills/pua/SKILL.md
```

Project-level install (current project only):

```bash
mkdir -p .opencode/skills/pua
curl -o .opencode/skills/pua/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanweai/pua/main/skills/pua/SKILL.md
```

## Works Well With

- `superpowers:systematic-debugging` — PUA adds motivation layer, systematic-debugging provides methodology
- `superpowers:verification-before-completion` — Prevents false "fixed" claims
